marys word tracker

tracks weather each day of a writing
tracks KEYWORDS: with colon after
if its a number it can be graphed over time


maybe do a spellcheck on elements?
or just have user manually enter
a list of things they want to track in all caps

MOVIE, name
SLEEP, number


.marydata should be filetype!! haha


could be a whole app using PyQt lol odear killme


marys notes: July 7th, 2018
here you go my boy


things for bucky to do: 
make list of tags (from previous text files)
make gui for mawy
add text after the number as a note to that day
add date box so you can change the entry in case i want to do a few days later or something
option to toggle cartoon rendering off/on
add way to make a list of non-numeric tags (ex: Movies), alphabetically or chronologically

ask for directory where to store the text files the program saves
